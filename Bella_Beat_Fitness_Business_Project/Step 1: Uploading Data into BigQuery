Step 1: Uploading Data into BigQuery
To begin my project, I created a Google Cloud project and set up a structured environment for data analysis in BigQuery. This involved the following steps:

Creating a Dataset: I initialized a dataset named bella_beat_fitbit to store and organize my project tables.

Uploading Raw Data: I imported the raw Fitbit dataset CSV files into BigQuery. Each file was uploaded as a separate table, such as DailyActivity, DailySteps, and SleepDay.

Ensuring Data Integrity: During the upload process, I verified the schema by defining column data types (e.g., INTEGER for numeric values and TIMESTAMP for date fields) to ensure compatibility with BigQuery's SQL processing.

Preparing for Cleaning and Analysis: These tables served as the foundation for further data cleaning and transformation using BigQuery's SQL capabilities.
