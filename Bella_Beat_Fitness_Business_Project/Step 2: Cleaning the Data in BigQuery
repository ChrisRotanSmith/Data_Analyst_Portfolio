Step 2: Cleaning the Data in BigQuery
Using BigQuery's SQL capabilities, I cleaned the Fitbit dataset to ensure it was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Below are the key steps:

Validating Column Types:
Ensured all columns had appropriate data types for analysis and transformations:


SELECT column_name, DATA_TYPE 
FROM `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE table_name = 'DailyActivity';
Handling Missing and Null Values
Identified and addressed missing values using dynamic SQL to efficiently check for NULLs across multiple columns:


-- Dynamic query to count NULLs in the 'SleepDays' table
DECLARE query_string STRING;
SET query_string = (
  SELECT STRING_AGG(
    FORMAT("SUM(CASE WHEN %s IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_%s", column_name, column_name), 
    ', '
  )
  FROM `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
  WHERE table_name = 'SleepDays'
);
SET query_string = FORMAT("""
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows, %s
  FROM `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.SleepDays`
""", query_string);
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE query_string;

Removing Duplicates:
Removed duplicate records from the SleepDays table to ensure data integrity:


SELECT *, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.SleepDays`
GROUP BY column_1, column_2  -- Specify relevant columns
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Normalizing Column Names
Standardized column names across all tables for easier analysis:


ALTER TABLE `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.DailyActivity`
RENAME COLUMN `TotalSteps` TO `total_steps`;

Standardizing Data Formats:
Standardized date formats in Excel and added derived columns for deeper analysis, such as total_hours_asleep and weekday:


ALTER TABLE `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.SleepDays`
ADD COLUMN total_hours_asleep FLOAT64;
UPDATE `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.SleepDays`
SET total_hours_asleep = ROUND(total_minutes_asleep / 60, 1);
Creating the Final Joined Table
Integrated all cleaned data into a single table, bellabeatfitbit_cleaned, for analysis in Tableau:


CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.bellabeatfitbit_cleaned` AS
SELECT da.*, dc.calories AS burned_calories, ds.total_steps AS total_daily_steps 
FROM `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.DailyActivity` AS da
LEFT JOIN `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.DailyCalories` AS dc 
ON da.Id = dc.Id AND da.activity_date = dc.activity_day
LEFT JOIN `bellabeatproject-447101.bella_beat_fitbit.DailySteps` AS ds 
ON da.Id = ds.Id AND da.activity_date = ds.activity_day;
Outcome:
The cleaned and joined dataset provided a reliable foundation for visualizations in Tableau, allowing for meaningful insights into activity, sleep, and calorie metrics.
