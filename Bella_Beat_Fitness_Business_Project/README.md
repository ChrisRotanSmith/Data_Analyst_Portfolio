# Bella_Beat_Fitness_Company
Data Analyst Project
Scenario:

I am junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth oppounities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

Company Bio: Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused sma products. Sršen used her background as an aist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.

By 2016, Bellabeat had opened oces around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional adveising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twier. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to suppo campaigns around key marketing dates.

Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more oppounities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze sma device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their sma devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

Business Task: 

Sršen asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.

For this project I will be using BigQuerySQL and Tableau for cleaning and analysis.

Data Preperation:

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from fitbit users. Eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

Sršen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another dataset to help address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.

To add more data, I added another dataset from the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES

Division of Public Health P-40109 (09/2005), Wisconisin, “Calories Burned Per Hour”.  This is a data set of calories burned per hour by activity and weight categories.
